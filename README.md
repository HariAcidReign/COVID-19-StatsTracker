<p> The purpose of this project is to simplify things for South Indians by providing accurate, constantly updated stats and nationwide news on the Coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p> The logic behind the project is simple <p>
<ul>
<li> Do web scraping from popular Indian news sites and pick up news only pertaining to the Coronavirus situation in India
<li> Use the covid19india API and pick out stats like : <strong> Active, Confirmed, Deceased and Recovered </strong> cases
<li> Create a website to display these information and then integrate Flask to achieve the same.
<li> Finally add some fancy gifs and animations for better UX
</ul>

<strong> NOTE: If you want to try it in your localhost, install Flask and open the folder in a virtual env </strong>

<p> Scope for improvement : If you are particularly bored, feel free to do a PR and refactor the CSS (it is a mess). I'll review it ASAP, i promise :) </p>
