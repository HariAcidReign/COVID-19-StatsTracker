# COVID-19-StatsTracker
<h3>A web app created to track the statistics of the Coronavirus, and curate top news from various sources into a simple, focused format</h3>

<p>With the onset of fake news and fake statistics to create panic among the common people, we decided to create a website to display reliable
India related COVID-19 news and accurate statistics of active, confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases for all the South Indian states - 
TamilNadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Telengana, and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
